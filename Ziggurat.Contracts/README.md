This is project contains CONTRACTS and only CONTRACTS.

A type that is allowed to travel between Bounded Contexts is considered to be a contract or a part of a contract.

Despite the fact that messages (commands and events) are contracts, this project is NOT a place for 
any helpers or extension methods for these types.
Helpers and extensions are typically used in some logical context and should belong to that specific context.

This project has its own reason to exist so please keep it nice and clear.
Thank you.
