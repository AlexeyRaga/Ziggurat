IMPORTANT NOTE!

This project represents INFRASTRUCTURE.

It MUST be agnostic to any business logic of any domain and MUST NOT contain any part of it.

It is NOT a "utils" project and MUST NOT be used as a place for extension methods 
for system types such as DateTime, String, etc. or for any other garbage you want to use "everywhere"
but don't know where to put.

This project has its own reason to exist so please keep it nice and clear.
Thank you.
